Quick Start
===========

This is a quick start tutorial of `MCDReforged <https://github.com/Fallen-Breath/MCDReforged>`__ (abbreviated as MCDR, omitted below)

Requirements
------------

MCDR requires python3 runtime. The python version need to be at least 3.6

Install
-------

MCDR is available in `pypi <https://pypi.org/project/mcdreforged>`__. It can be installed via ``pip`` command

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install mcdreforged

For Chinese users, you can added a ``-i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple`` prefix to the command to use `Tsinghua tuna mirror <https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/pypi/>`__ to speed up the installation

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install mcdreforged -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple

Start up
--------

Let's say your are going to start MCDR in a folder named ``my_mcdr_server``. Then you can run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd my_mcdr_server
   python -m mcdreforged

At the first run, MCDR will generated the default configure and permission files, as well as some default folders. The file structure will be like this

.. code-block::

   my_mcdr_server/
    ├─ config/
    ├─ logs/
    │   └─ MCDR.log
    ├─ plugins/
    ├─ server/
    ├─ config.yml
    └─ permission.yml

Now put your server files into the server folder (``server`` by default), then modify the configuration file ``config.yml`` and permission file ``permission.yml`` correctly. After you can start MCDR again and it correctly launch and handle the server

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m mcdreforged

Upgrade
-------

With the help of `pypi <https://pypi.org/project/mcdreforged/>`__, MCDR can be easily upgraded via a single command

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install mcdreforged --upgrade

That's it! 

For Chinese users, you can use tuna mirror to speed up the upgrading too

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install mcdreforged --upgrade -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple

Development builds are available in `Test PyPi <https://test.pypi.org/project/mcdreforged/#history>`__, you can install them if you have special needs

Launch from source
------------------

Instead of installing MCDR from pypi, you can execute the source file of MCDR directly. 

Download the source files of MCDR in the `github release page <https://github.com/Fallen-Breath/MCDReforged/releases>`__, and decompress the file to your server folder

.. code-block::

   my_mcdr_server/
    ├─ mcdreforged/
    │   └─ ..
    ├─ MCDReforged.py
    └─ ..

Then you can start MCDR with the same command as above

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m mcdreforged

Alternatively you can execute ``MCDReforged.py`` with python to start MCDR

.. code-block:: bash

   python MCDReforged.py

``MCDReforged.py`` is just a simple wrapper for launching MCDR with the following codes

.. code-block:: python

   import sys

   from mcdreforged.__main__ import main

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       sys.exit(main())

``MCDReforged.py`` also works for MCDR installed by ``pip`` command

For windows users, if you have bound a correct python interpreter to ``*.py`` files you can also double click the ``MCDReforged.py`` to start MCDR
