MCDR Plugin
===========

What is a MCDR plugin
---------------------

An MCDR plugin is a python source file with ``.py`` file extension located in plugin directories. The list of the plugin directory can be defined inside the `configure file <../configure.html#plugin_directories>`__

At start up, MCDR will automatically load every plugin inside the plugin directories. Additionally, MCDR will append all the plugin directories into ``sys.path``, so plugins can import modules placed inside the plugin folders directly

There is a sample plugin named ``SamplePlugin.py`` in the ``plugins/`` folder in github source and you can check its content for reference

Quick Start
-----------

Open one of the plugin directories of MCDR, create a file named ``HelloWorld.py``

.. code-block:: bash

   cd my_plugin_folder
   touch HelloWorld.py

open it and enter these code

.. code-block:: python

   PLUGIN_METADATA = {
       'id': 'hello_world',
       'version': '1.0.0',
       'name': 'My Hello World Plugin'
   }


   def on_load(server, old):
       server.logger.info('Hello world!')

Return to MCDR console, enter ``!!MCDR reload plugin``, and you should see the hello world message from your plugin

.. code-block::

   [TaskExecutor/INFO] [hello_world]: Hello world!

Great, you have successfully created your first plugin

Metadata
--------

The meta data field provides the basic information of the plugin. As you can see in the `Quick Start <#quick-start>`__ section above, meta data is declared in the global scope. It's a dict contains several key-value with the name ``PLUGIN_METADATA``

Here's a metadata field with all possible key-values

.. code-block:: python

   PLUGIN_METADATA = {
       'id': 'my_plugin_id',
       'version': '1.0.0',
       'name': 'My Plugin',  # RText component is allowed
       'description': 'A plugin to do something cool',  # RText component is allowed
       'author': 'myself',
       'link': 'https://github.com',
       'dependencies': {
           'mcdreforged': '>=1.0.0',
           'an_important_api': '*'
       }
   }

If a plugin doesn't not declare the meta data field, a warning will arise in the console and the fallback values will be used

id
^^

Id, or plugin id, is the identity string of your plugin. It should consist of lowercase letters, numbers and underscores with a length of 1 to 64

Here's some available plugin ids:


* ``my_plugin``
* ``anotherhelper123``
* ``__a_cool_plugin__``

But the following ids are not allowed:


* ``MyPlugin``
* ``another-helper-123``
* ``a cool plugin``

MCDR uses plugin id to distinguish between different plugins and check the dependencies. All loaded plugin in MCDR contain different plugin ids. If a newly loaded plugin has a plugin id exactly the same with an existed plugin, the new plugin will fail to load

Choose your plugin id wisely. It's highly suggested to keep your plugin id not changed after release your plugin


* Field key: ``id``
* Value type: str
* Fallback value: the file name without the ``.py`` extension

version
^^^^^^^

The version value indicates the version of your value. It's mostly in `semver <https://semver.org/>`__ format but it has less restriction such as you can have the core version with any length

Here's some available version:


* ``1.0.0``
* ``2.0``
* ``1.2.3-pre4``
* ``1.8.9-rc.8``
* ``1.14.1-beta.4+build.54``

Following `semver <https://semver.org/>`__ format for you version string is a good idea. It's easier to maintain and for people to understand


* Field key: ``version``
* Value type: str
* Fallback value: ``0.0.0``

name
^^^^

The name of your plugin. Give your plugin with a nice name with any kinds of characters. `RText <api.html#rtext>`__ is allowed here

Try not to make the name too long. For more details of your plugin, you can put them into the ``description``


* Field key: ``name``
* Value type: str or RTextBase
* Fallback value: The plugin id

description
^^^^^^^^^^^

The description of you plugin. Put the details of your plugin here. `RText <api.html#rtext>`__ is allowed too

This field is optional, you can just ignore it if you are lazy


* Field key: ``description``
* Value type: str or RTextBase
* Fallback value: None

author
^^^^^^

The authors of the plugins. If there's only a single author, you can also use a string instead of a list of string

This field is optional, you can just ignore it if you are lazy


* Field key: ``author``
* Value type: str or List[str]
* Fallback value: None

link
^^^^

The url to your plugin. You can put a link to the github repository of your plugin here. It should be an available url

This field is optional, you can just ignore it if you are lazy


* Field key: ``link``
* Value type: str
* Fallback value: None

dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A dict of dependencies you plugin relies on. It's a dict contains several key-value pairs. The key is the id of the plugin that your plugin is relies on, and the value is the version requirement of the plugin that your plugin is relies on

If your plugin has requirement to the version of MCDR, use ``mcdreforged`` as the plugin id

A version requirement is a string than contains several criterions of the version. Criterions are divided by space character, each criterion is made up of an operator and a base version string. Wildcard is allowed when describing the base version

List of the operators:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Operator
     - Example
     - Explanation for the example
     - Accepted
     - Unaccepted
   * - >=
     - >=1.2.3
     - The target version should be equal to or newer than 1.2.3
     - 1.2.3, 1.3.0
     - 1.2.0
   * - >
     - >1.2.3
     - The target version should be newer than 1.2.3
     - 1.2.4, 1.3.0
     - 1.2.0, 1.2.3
   * - <=
     - <=1.2.3
     - The target version should be equal to or older than 1.2.3
     - 1.2.3, 1.1.0
     - 1.2.4, 2.0.0
   * - <
     - <1.2.3
     - The target version should be older than 1.2.3
     - 1.1.0
     - 1.2.3, 1.5
   * - =
     - =1.2.3
     - The target version should equal to 1.2.3
     - 1.2.3
     - 1.2, 1.2.4
   * - 
     - 1.2.3
     - If the operator is not specified, ``=`` is used as default. In this case the target version should equal to 1.2.3
     - 1.2.3
     - 1.2, 1.2.4
   * - ^
     - ^1.2.3
     - The target version should be equal to or newer than 1.2.3, and the first version segment of the target version should be equal to the base version
     - 1.2.3, 1.2.4, 1.4.4
     - 1.0.0, 2.0.0
   * - ~
     - ~1.2.3
     - The target version should be equal to or newer than 1.2.3, and the first and the second version segment of the target version should be equal to the base version
     - 1.2.3, 1.2.4
     - 1.0.0, 1.4.4, 2.0.0


Check `here <https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning>`__ for more detail to the version requirement

If there are multiple declared criterions, the target version is accepted only when it's accepted by all criterions

Here a dependencies example:

.. code-block:: python

   'dependencies': {
       'mcdreforged': '>=1.0.0 <2.0',
       'my_library': '>=1.0.0',
       'an_important_api': '*',
       'another_api_1': '1.0.*',
       'another_api_2': '2.7.x',
   }

MCDR will make sure only when all dependency requirements are satisfied your plugin will get loaded successfully. Missing dependency, dependency version not match or dependency loop will result in a dependency check failure

This field is optional, you can just ignore it if your plugin doesn't have any dependency


* Field key: ``dependencies``
* Value type: Dict[str, str]
* Fallback value: None

Plugin Registry
---------------

Plugin registry is a collection of things that plugin registered for. It will get cleaned up every time before the plugin gets loaded, so you'd better register them in `Plugin_Load <event.html#plugin-load>`__ event

Event listeners
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are 2 methods to register an event listener for you plugin


#. 
   Declare a function inside the global slope with the specific name. It's the legacy registering method to register a listener and it only works with events provided by MCDR. Check `here <event.html#default-event-listener>`__ for more detail

   For example, the widely-used function below is a default `Plugin Loaded <event.html#plugin-loaded>`__ event listener

   .. code-block:: python

       def on_load(server, prev):
           do_something()

#. 
   Manually invoke ``server.register_event_listener`` method to register an event listener. You can specify the callable object and the priority for the event listener

   Check `here <event.html#register-a-event-listener>`__ for more detail about event listener registering

   Here some examples about manually register event listeners

   .. code-block:: python

       def my_on_mcdr_general_info(server, info):
           pass

       def on_my_task_done(server, my_task_info, my_task_data):  # the 2nd and 3rd parameter is determined by the plugin that emits this event
           pass

       def on_load(server, prev):
           server.register_event_listener('mcdr.general_info', my_on_mcdr_general_info, priority=500)  # TODO: use better event identifier
           server.register_event_listener('myplugin.task_done', on_my_task_done)  # TODO: use better event identifier

Take a look at the reference of ``register_event_listener`` method in `ServerInterface <classes/ServerInterface.html#register-event-listener>`__ document for more detail

Command
^^^^^^^

Rather than manually parsing ``info.content`` inside user info event callback like ``on_user_info``, MCDR provides a command system for plugins to register their commands

Check the `command <command>`__ document for more detail about building a command tree

Assuming that you have already built a command tree with root literal node *root*, then you can use the following code to register your command tree in MCDR

.. code-block:: python

   server.register_command(root)

Take a look at the reference of ``register_command`` method in `ServerInterface <classes/ServerInterface.html#register-command>`__ document for more details of its usage

Help message
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Plugin can register its help message with ``server.register_help_message`` to MCDR, so that users can use `!!help command <../command.html#help-command>`__ to view the help messages of all commands

Take a look at the reference of ``register_help_message`` method in `ServerInterface <classes/ServerInterface.html#register-help-message>`__ document for more details of its usage
