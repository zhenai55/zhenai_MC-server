CommandError
============

Sometimes when executing a command, the MCDR command parsing system might fail to parse the command for some reason. At that time if you have registered a error listener in the command tree node you will receive a CommandError instance. There are a few useful method of the CommandError instance for plugin developers

Method
------

get_parsed_command
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

   def get_parsed_command(self) -> str

Return a prefix of the input command that has been successfully parsed

get_failed_command
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

   def get_failed_command(self) -> str:

Return a prefix of the input command that is parsing when the failure occurs

set_handled
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

   def set_handled(self) -> None

When handling the command error by error listener on the command tree node, you can use this method to tell MCDR the command error has been handled, so MCDR will not display the default command failure message to the command source like ``Unknown argument: !!MCDR reload this<--``
