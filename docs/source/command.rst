Command is the most common way for users to interact with MCDR. MCDR consider all console input and player chat messages from the server as user inputs. For them, MCDR will try to parse the input as a command

Commands can be registered by MCDR itself and by plugins. This page only introduces about commands from MCDR. For plugin registered command, check `here <plugin_dev/command>`__

Example:

Let's say there's is a loaded plugin with id ``my_plugin`` and a disabled plugin in path ``plugins/another_plugin.py.disabled`` with id ``another_plugin``

Then you can do the following commands

.. code-block::

   !!MCDR plg info my_plugin
   !!MCDR plugin reload my_plugin
   !!MCDR plugin enable another_plugin.py.disabled
   !!MCDR plugin unload another_plugin
   !!MCDR plugin load another_plugin.py

These commands do the following things:


#. Query the information about the plugin with id ``my_plugin``
#. Reload the plugin with id ``my_plugin``
#. Enable and load the disabled plugin with file name ``another_plugin.py.disabled``. It has plugin id ``another_plugin``
#. Unload the plugin with id ``another_plugin``
#. Reload the plugin with file name ``another_plugin.py``. Note that since this plugin is not loaded, you can only use file name to specify it

Update checking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``!!MCDR checkupdate``, or ``!!MCDR cu``. Use it to manually check update from github

It will try to get the latest release version in github, and check if it's newer than the current version. If it is, it will show the update logs from the github release

!!help command
--------------

``!!help`` command is place to display the help messages of all commands. It works as an index of all commands

The content of this command can be registered by plugins, so a new user can easily browse all available commands that it can access

Any user is allowed to use this command, and MCDR will list all command help messages that the user has enough permission level to see

Without any plugin, you may see the result below after you entered the ``!!help`` command

   MCDR command help message list
   !!MCDR: MCDR control command
   !!help: MCDR command help messages
